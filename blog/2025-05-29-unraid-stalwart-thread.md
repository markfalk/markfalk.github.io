I recently posted to the official [Unraid forums](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/190422-self-host-email-using-stalwart-bind-and-wireguard/) about my [Stalwart implementation instructions](/docs/self-hosting-mail).

So far there has been one poster who's tailored their implementation but was able to get some useful knowledge out of my
work. Thankfully I've saved them "hours of head-scratching". ðŸ˜€

I'll check with them to see if they've run into any issues which could use clarification or help me update the instructions.
