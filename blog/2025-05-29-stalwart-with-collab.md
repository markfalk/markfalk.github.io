Excited to see that [Stalwart now supports native support for calendars, contacts, and file storage](https://stalw.art/blog/collaboration). Congratulations to the team!

I'm still using other solutions for calendar and contacts, but would like to experiment with this. Having
well working clients for use by family members is a major requirement.

As a privacy advocate having my docs not crawled by Google would be a nice thing.

I'm currently still using SMB for file storage and sharing. I would need to understand the workflow for managing
file storage and ensuring proper backups and recovery. Going from a filesystem to blob storage would be a major
change.
