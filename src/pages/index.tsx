  <h2>üëî About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Mark Falk, a Site Reliability Engineer with a background in DevOps, Networking, and Systems Administration.
    While I'm relatively new to the formal title of SRE, I've spent years designing and operating reliable production systems
    with a strong focus on observability, automation, and reducing operational toil.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got my start writing software in C and Java, and I've always been drawn to understanding how things work under the hood‚Äîwhether it's the kernel, a network protocol, or the internals of a database. 
  That curiosity has shaped the way I approach systems: with attention to performance, reliability, and the often-overlooked details that make things tick.
</p>  <p>
    This site serves as a living record of my technical journey‚Äîdocumenting what I'm building, how I'm thinking, and what I'm learning along the way.
    I'm currently exploring new opportunities and open to roles that align with my values and skills.
