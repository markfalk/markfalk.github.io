          <p>
            I'm Mark Falk, a Site Reliability Engineer with a background in DevOps, networking, and software development.
            While I'm relatively new to the formal title of SRE, I've spent years designing and operating reliable production systems
            with a strong focus on observability, automation, and reducing operational toil.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my start writing software in C and Java, and I've always been drawn to understanding how things work under the hoodâ€”whether it's the kernel, a network protocol, or the internals of a database.
            That curiosity has shaped the way I approach systems: with attention to performance, reliability, and the often-overlooked details that make things tick.
          </p>  <p>
            This site serves as a living record of my technical journeyâ€”documenting what I'm building, how I'm thinking, and what I'm learning along the way.
            I'm currently exploring new opportunities and open to roles that align with my values and skills.
